I'm a CS PhD candidate in Statistics & Machine Learning (SMILE) labortary of CityUHK. My supervisor is Prof. Jiawei Ma and Prof. Zhicong Lu (now in GMU). I am currently focusing on a series of LLM application issues, such as optimizing the inference/reasoning/knowledge retrieval process of domain expert LLM models. Before joining SMILE, I did two years of research in user interface study and HCI. My research philosophy is to take solving or optimizing practical problems as the starting point of all research (either technical or empirical). My email address is piaohongwang@gmail.com.
